Hi, I'm Shakuntala! I'm an early career data scientist with a passion for artificial intelligence and biology. My journey into the world of data science began during my undergraduate studies, where I sought out ways to use data to answer complex problems in biological research and found a second home in the data science community. Since then, I have been working in the biotech industry on CAR-T cell immunotherapies, sports medicine, and humanitarian use devices. I am most interested in using AI for personalized medicine, and drug discovery. 

I recently began my Masters studies in Artificial Intelligence at Johns Hopkins University. As a neurodivergent woman of color, I am extremely passionate about supporting diversity in tech and increasing access to scientific knowledge through open science/open data science. As I progress through my Masters, I plan to share more about my experiences and how I've been participating in open source communities.
