Hello, I'm Shakuntala! I'm an early career data scientist fueled by my passion for artificial intelligence and biology. 
For the last 4 years, I've worked in labs across the biotech industry, contributing to CAR-T cell immunotherapies, sports medicine, and humanitarian use devices. Now, I'm looking to transition to a career as a data scientist, where I will be able to apply my research experience and scientific skills in new ways.

As a Masters student at Johns Hopkins University, I am studying Artificial Intelligence. My primary focus is exploring ways to leverage AI for personalized medicine and advancing drug discovery. I am deeply committed to fostering diversity in the tech field and promoting wider access to scientific knowledge through open science and open data science initiatives. As I progress through my Masters program, I look forward to sharing my experiences and active involvement within open source communities.

I am open to new professional opportunities! Please email me if you are hiring and believe we would be a good fit.
