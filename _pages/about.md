Hello, I'm Shakuntala! I'm an early career data scientist with 4 years of hands-on experience in the Medical Device and Life Science industries. 

I previously worked as an Associate Data Scientist to develop machine learning algorithms to detect anomalies in clinical telemetry data streams. I am now studying Artificial Intelligence as a Masters student at Johns Hopkins University. My primary focus is exploring ways to leverage AI for personalized medicine and drug discovery. 

I am deeply committed to fostering diversity in the tech field and promoting wider access to scientific knowledge through open science and open data science initiatives. As I progress through my Masters program, I look forward to sharing my experiences and active involvement within open source communities.
